# Hello, I'm Matt Peters. Thanks for stopping by my page!

I am a curious, dedicated, and passionate cybersecurity professional with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to learning and continuous improvement. In my career thusfar, I have enjoyed performing investigative and analytical work as a records auditor in the financial services industry. My problem with this field was that the learning stopped after I fully understood how the business (and Excel) operates. I feel that cybersecurity is a field I would thrive in due to the demanding nature of the work, the continuous need for improvement, and the need for analytical and critical thinking. My approach to solving a problem is to first see if the answer already exists i.e consult documentation. If the problem requires a new solution, this is where I go to work utilizing my experiences and critical thinking abilities to solve problems coated in complexity and uncertainity. I aom to demonstrate these abilites in my projects below.

## Objective

My journey in developing my skills in cybersecurity combined with my first-hand experiences in being targeted by cyber crime has fueled my passion for cybersecurity. I am now eager to transition into this field armed with my background in business and risk assessment, specifically aiming to join an Information Security/SOC Analyst role while bringing new insights and ideas to the table with a focus on protecting information and driving better business decisions.

## Upcoming Projects
I am currently working on enhancing the Security Operations Center (SOC) environment by integrating a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform by deploying Docker containers on an Ubuntu server. This deployment will include three key tools: TheHive, Cortex, and MISP.
TheHive is an incident response platform that allows security analysts to manage and collaborate on incidents efficiently. It provides a centralized dashboard for tracking alerts, documenting findings, and coordinating responses.
Cortex complements TheHive by offering a variety of analyzers and responders that automate the processing of security alerts. It can integrate with threat intelligence feeds and perform automated actions based on predefined playbooks, significantly reducing the time analysts spend on repetitive tasks such as investigating and triaging alerts.
MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) is designed for sharing structured threat intelligence. It allows organizations to collaborate by sharing data on threats, indicators of compromise, and attack patterns. This not only enriches the data available to the SOC but also enhances the effectiveness of TheHive and Cortex by providing contextual information for better decision-making.
